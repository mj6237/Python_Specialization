Ask the user to input a sentence. 
2. Initialize a vowel_count variable to 0. 
3. Define a string of vowels: vowels = "aeiou". 
4. Loop through each character in the input sentence. 
5. Convert the character to lowercase. 
6. If the lowercase character is in the vowels string, increment vowel_count. 
7. Print the final vowel_count. 
ï‚· Simple Hints:
